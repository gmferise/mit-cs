# MIT Computer Science Self-Study Courselist
**Compiled By:** Gavin Ferise

Based loosely on the track at https://catalog.mit.edu/degree-charts/computer-science-engineering-course-6-3/

Rather than Semesters, courses are grouped into Phases. Each set of courses in a single Phase can be completed in any order, including in parallel, and completing a Phase will automatically fulfill the prerequisites for all courses in the next Phase. Feel free to jump ahead if desired however.

# Workload Estimations
One MIT unit is approximately equal to 14 hours of work per term (15 weeks). Most courses are 12 units, which is roughly 11.2 hours a week for 15 weeks, or 40 hours a week for 4.2 weeks.

IAP courses are 4 weeks long and likely 6 units, which is roughly 22.4 hours a week, or 40 hours a week for 2.1 weeks.

**Overall this course list is likely to take 2-2.5 years of full-time work to complete.**
